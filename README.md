# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains code samples from ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).

The code is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. Michal Daniel Dobrzanski
has a repository for Python 3
[here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35). 

This repo contains code for running the neural network exercise at the end of Chapter 1.
